Here are some stuff that I made in VSCode, in one Github repo. We have a Discord ~~and Guilded~~ server!
Our Guilded server has been removed due to their [stupid update](https://www.guilded.gg/blog/update-to-guilded-login-requirements)

hope uh nothing wrong happens and i can't fix it

if you saw every file, thank you, it took quite a lot of time to make solo.

random lua code snippet:

```lua
function printing()
        yeah = "Haha yes"
        print(yeah)
end

wait(2.5)

printing()


-- it prints "haha yes" 👍
```
